# GPS Data Visualization Tool

Welcome to the **GPS Data Visualization Tool**, an intuitive and powerful web application that allows you to upload geospatial datasets and instantly create interactive maps with customizable grouping and labeling. This tool is designed for analysts, researchers, and enthusiasts who need fast, clear visualization of GPS coordinate data.

## üöÄ Features

- **Easy Data Upload:** Supports Excel (.xlsx) and CSV files for quick data ingestion.
- **Automatic GPS Detection:** Detects latitude and longitude columns automatically for mapping.
- **Flexible Grouping:** Generate multiple maps based on grouping variables (e.g., village, block).
- **Custom Labeling:** Add multiple labeling variables for detailed popup information on map points.
- **Interactive Maps:** Maps are built with Folium to allow zoom, pan, and clickable markers.
- **Downloadable Results:** Export maps as individual HTML files packaged in a downloadable ZIP archive.
- **Smooth User Experience:** Includes live progress updates, loading animations, and data previews.
- **Future-proof:** Upcoming advanced analytics, clustering, heatmaps, and route optimization planned!

## üìÅ Data Format

Please ensure your dataset includes:

- Columns named **`latitude`** and **`longitude`** (case insensitive) with decimal coordinates.
- Optional columns for grouping and labeling your data points.
- Minimal missing or invalid data in GPS columns to ensure accurate visualization.

Example:

| latitude | longitude | village | household_id | category |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 40.7128  | -74.0060  | VillageA| H001         | A        |
| 34.0522  | -118.2437 | VillageB| H002         | B        |

## üéØ How to Use

1. Access the live application here: [GPS Data Visualization Tool](https://gps-viz-chatbot.streamlit.app/)  
2. Upload your dataset via the provided uploader.  
3. Choose grouping variables to create separate maps or leave blank for a single map.  
4. Select labeling variables to display informative popups on each map marker.  
5. Enable mapping visualization and generate your maps.  
6. Download all generated maps as a ZIP file for offline use.
